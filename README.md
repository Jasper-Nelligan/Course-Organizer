# Course-Organizer
A customizable webpage geared towards organizing your links for online learning! Great for keeping your 
zoom links, class websites, and assignments all in one page. Additionally, you can upload an image of your
class schedule so you don't miss class.

The website is live at https://jasper-nelligan.github.io/Link-Organizer/.

An example of using the webpage to create a new course with links:
